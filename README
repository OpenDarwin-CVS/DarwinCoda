This project contains Darwin and MacOS X specific utilities that
hopefully will enable the use of the Coda file system on 
those platforms.

The Coda File system is a Research project, not a product.  So if
you use it, expect anything to happen.

This part, which concerns the DARWIN/MacOSX platform isn't even a
Research project.  It depends entirely of the commitment of interested
individuals. Thus, there are no warranties whatsoever, and no support
except at the grace of those who wants to see Coda on the Mac/Darwin
platform.

For more information on the Coda file system, see http://coda.cs.cmu.edu
